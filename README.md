## Summary
> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered

My implementation comprises `<number>` new software components, totaling `<number>` added lines of code over the previous implementation. Key challenges included `I was not able to solve them`.

## Correctness & Performance Characterization
> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation

*Correctness*: I wrote `<number>` tests; these tests take `<time>` to execute. 

*Performance*: Launching a 100 nodes takes about `<time>` seconds, and propagating a message to the entire network via gossip.send at that scale takes about `<time>` seconds â€” assuming the following protocol configuration: `<e.g., message frequency, subset function, etc.>`.

## Key Feature
> What is the point of having a gossip protocol? Why doesn't a node just send the message to _all_ other nodes in its group?

## Time to Complete
> Roughly, how many hours did this milestone take you to complete?

Hours: `25 and I did not finish.`


notes:
- I implemented local, except for gossip
- Now i am working on implementing the all
